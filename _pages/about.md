I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at New York University, focusing on Dark Matter Phenomenology, Computational Particle Physics, and Cosmology. I work under the supervision of Prof. Joshua Ruderman, and my research explores one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics—dark matter. I investigate the nature of dark matter by designing particle physics models, running cosmological simulations, and analyzing these models by comparing their predictions with data from cosmological observations. My broader goal is to deepen our understanding of physics beyond the Standard Model through both theoretical development and the creation of numerical tools to test new ideas.

Before joining Prof. Ruderman’s group, I conducted research in biophysics with Prof. Alexandra Zidovska. There, I studied nucleolar dynamics in HeLa cells. By measuring chromatin motion inside the nucleus, we developed a theoretical model describing effective attractive forces between nucleoli. Using 3D simulations based on this model, we successfully reproduced experimental observations of nucleolar volume distributions and dynamic behavior.

Prior to starting my graduate studies at NYU, I completed my undergraduate degree at the Free University of Tbilisi, where I investigated charged particle dynamics in wormhole spacetimes. Through numerical analysis, we identified the conditions under which particles could traverse and escape the wormhole.

Over the past 12 years, I have taught a wide range of subjects. My dedication to education has been recognized through several teaching awards and consistently strong student feedback. You can find more details on my teaching experience under the Teaching and CV section.

Outside of research, I am passionate about science communication, education, and public outreach. I also enjoy a wide variety of hobbies, including cooking, fishing, hiking, traveling with my family, film photography, leatherworking, fly tying, and gardening.


I am currently exploring opportunities in [academia / industry / science policy / data science / etc.] where I can apply my skills in [e.g., modeling, problem solving, programming, teaching, etc.] to [impact goal].
