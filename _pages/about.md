I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at New York University, focusing on Dark Matter Phenomenology, Computational Particle Physics, and Cosmology. I investigate the nature of dark matter by designing particle physics models, running cosmological simulations, and analyzing these models by comparing their predictions with data from cosmological observations. Currently, I study <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03(2025)018">CDB spectral distortion</a> and anisotropy due to dark photon.

Previously, I conducted research in biophysics and studied <a href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(24)00006-7?uuid=uuid%3Aaf6c3432-b237-4675-84bc-524e4bf15b3a">nucleolar dynamics in HeLa cells</a>. By measuring chromatin motion inside the nucleus, we developed a theoretical model describing effective attractive forces between nucleoli and with 3D simulations we successfully reproduced experimental observations of nucleolai volume distributions and dynamics.

Prior to starting my graduate studies at NYU, I completed my undergraduate degree at the Free University of Tbilisi, where I investigated <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S021827181750153X">charged particle dynamics in wormhole spacetimes</a>. Through numerical analysis, we identified the conditions under which particles could traverse and escape the wormhole.

Over the past 12 years, I have taught a wide range of subjects. My dedication to education has been recognized through several teaching awards and consistently strong student feedback. 

Outside of research, I am passionate about science communication, education, and public outreach. I also enjoy a wide variety of hobbies, including cooking, fishing, hiking, traveling with my family, film photography, leatherworking, fly tying, and gardening.
