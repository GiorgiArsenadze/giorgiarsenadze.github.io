The dark photon is a hypothetical particle that offers one of the few possible renormalizable connections between the Standard Model of particle physics and a hidden dark sector. A significant body of research is dedicated to detecting dark photons, particularly at very low masses. These efforts include terrestrial experiments such as Cavendish–Coulomb setups, light-shining-through-wall experiments, helioscopes, and the direct detection of dark photons emitted by the Sun. The search also extends to astrophysical phenomena such as stellar energy loss and black hole superradiance. Furthermore, the electromagnetic environments of planets like Jupiter and Earth offer useful constraints on extremely light dark photons. However, these searches are fundamentally limited as the interaction between dark photons and Standard Model particles weakens dramatically when the dark photon mass approaches zero.

Among all detection methods, distortions to the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are among the most sensitive ways to probe dark photon properties. In the early universe, CMB photons were in thermal equilibrium with baryons and followed a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum. This distribution remains largely unchanged to the present day, as confirmed by the COBE-FIRAS experiment, which measured deviations to be less than one part in ten thousand. Future experiments such as PIXIE, PRISM, and SPECTER aim to improve this sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. Any process that injects or removes photons from the CMB after thermal equilibrium can leave a signature in the form of spectral distortions, making the CMB an excellent probe for dark photons and other hidden-sector particles.

One potential source of distortion is the conversion of regular photons into dark photons through a process known as kinetic mixing. These conversions can occur throughout the history of the universe, especially when the density of free electrons causes the effective mass of photons to match the mass of the dark photon. The nature and timing of these conversions determine how the resulting spectral distortions evolve. In particular, there is a clear distinction between the effects produced before and after the era of recombination, when the universe transitioned from opaque to transparent.

Our work focuses on scenarios where dark photon conversions occur before recombination, a regime that had not been fully explored in previous studies. In this period, photon scattering with electrons was highly efficient and can significantly alter the resulting distortions. We model these effects using a Green's function approach to photon injection and removal. By comparing the predicted spectral distortions with COBE-FIRAS data, we derive new and robust constraints on the dark photon’s kinetic mixing parameter across a wide range of masses.

We show that our constraints strengthen existing limits by up to a factor of three. These results are particularly relevant for upcoming laboratory experiments such as DarkSRF, which aim to explore the same mass range using complementary techniques. Additionally, the spectral shape of the distortion provides a unique fingerprint that could help distinguish dark photon signals from other new physics scenarios in future high-precision CMB observations.

The CMB remains one of the most powerful tools for testing fundamental physics. Its extreme precision makes it a natural place to search for the subtle effects caused by particles in the hidden universe. Our work provides a self-consistent and data-driven method for probing dark photon physics, setting the stage for deeper exploration in the years ahead.

    The figure illustrates dark photon constraints and projections derived from distortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum. The solid colored line represents current constraints based on the COBE-FIRAS dataset, shown at the 95% confidence level. The dashed colored line shows a future projection based on the proposed PIXIE satellite, which is expected to have sensitivity approximately 10,000 times greater than FIRAS, assuming ideal foreground removal.

Each color in the plot corresponds to a specific era of CMB spectral distortion: purple represents the free-streaming era, blue the y-era, green the transition between the mu and y-eras, orange the mu-era, and red a later y-era. The dotted green lines indicate regions where uncertainties in the modeling approach—specifically in the transition era—may become important. A red dotted line highlights regions where very large distortions are expected due to high photon-to-dark-photon conversion probabilities; in these areas, the standard modeling method is no longer applicable. These distortions, although occurring deep in the thermal era, produce significant visible effects that cannot be removed by adjusting the CMB temperature baseline.

For context, the figure also includes existing experimental limits and projections from a variety of sources. These include laboratory-based searches such as DarkSRF, CROWS, and Coulomb-force experiments; direct detection experiments like XENON1T; and astrophysical observations involving the Sun, Jupiter, and Earth. Gray lines indicate these external constraints, while a gray dashed line shows the projected reach of upcoming experiments like the DarkSRF Pathfinder. Recent studies based on the Planck satellite’s CMB power spectrum have also provided constraints, though these are generally weaker than those from COBE-FIRAS and are not shown here. Another study using data from Planck and unWISE surveys has reported particularly strong constraints at very low dark photon masses, which are included in the plot for comparison.
