The dark photon $A'$ is a hypothetical particle that can open one of only a few renormalizable portals between the Standard Model (SM) sector and the dark sector. A significant research program is ongoing to detect dark photons with a mass of $m_{A'} \lesssim $10^{-3}eV$. The dark photon parameter space can be tested by terrestrial experiments, such as Cavendish-Coulomb experiments, Light-Shining-Through-Walls experiments, helioscopes and the direct detection of dark photons produced in the Sun. 
The dark photon parameter space can also be tested through astrophysical probes such as stellar energy loss and black hole superradiance. Moreover, because the dark photon can impact the SM electromagnetic field through the kinetic mixing portal, the magnetosphere of Jupiter and Earth can also be used to constrain the kinetic mixing parameter of ultralight dark photons in the $10^{-16} - 10^{-13}$ $eV$ mass range. For a complete review of dark photon limits, one can refer to. All dark photon searches are, however, limited by the decoupling of all interactions with the SM when the dark photon mass vanishes, $m_{A'} \rightarrow 0$, which makes detection increasingly difficult at low masses. 


Compared with the aforementioned detection methods, distortions to the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) serve as one of the most sensitive ways to explore the dark photon parameter space for $m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-4}eV$. 
In the early universe, CMB photons were in chemical equilibrium with baryons, and their phase space density obeyed the blackbody distribution with zero chemical potential.
Within standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, this blackbody distribution should be mostly preserved through the process of recombination until the present day. 
The COBE-FIRAS measurement of this spectrum confirmed this prediction, finding that any deviation of the CMB phase space from a blackbody distribution has to be less than 1 part in $10^4$. Next-generation measurements of the CMB spectrum will have much better sensitivity: the proposed PIXIE, PRISM, Voyage 2050 and SPECTER experiments aim to measure CMB spectral distortions that are as small as $10^{-10}$-$10^{-8}$ times the CMB blackbody intensity. Any exotic process that injects energy into the CMB, after the CMB photons fall out of chemical equilibrium, potentially imprints a distortion away from the blackbody spectrum. 
Precise measurements of the CMB spectrum are therefore a powerful tool for detecting not just dark photons, but also axions, dark matter decay/annihilation/scattering, and inflation.

Significant spectral distortions caused by dark photons can arise if photons $\gamma$ and $A'$ kinetically mix, resulting in a sufficiently large probability of  $\gamma \to A'$ conversions throughout cosmic history, removing photons from the CMB blackbody spectrum. 
The conversion probability of CMB photons into dark photons is dominated by resonant conversions between the two states, which occur whenever the effective plasma mass of the SM photon $\gamma$---induced mainly by the density of free electrons---matches $m_{A'}$, the dark photon mass. 



The impact of $\gamma \to A'$ on the CMB spectrum can be classified into two broad regimes: $m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-9}eV$, and $m_{A'} \gtrsim 10^{-9}eV$. 
For $m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-9}eV$, resonant conversions only occur after recombination when photons are free-streaming; the distorted spectrum produced as a result of $\gamma \to A'$ evolves only through redshifting as a function of time after the conversion has occurred. 
This regime was first studied in {% cite Mirizzi:2009iz %}, and extended to include the effect of inhomogeneities on resonance conversion by {% cite Caputo:2020bdy %},{% cite Caputo:2020rnx %},{% cite Bondarenko:2020moh %}.  
The signal from the inverse process, $A' \to \gamma$, for dark photon dark matter have been discussed in literature as well. In this work we assume that there is no initial abundance of the dark photon, and consider only the $\gamma \rightarrow A'$ process.

More recently, {% cite Pirvu:2023lch %} have examined the impact of $\gamma \to A'$ on the CMB anisotropy power spectrum. 
These results rely on the fact that $\gamma \to A'$ resonant conversion is highly sensitive to the free electron number density, and is therefore correlated with cosmic structures, leading to nontrivial spatial correlations. 
These works have demonstrated impressive limits for $m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-9}eV$, when $\gamma \to A'$ occurs after recombination.


In our paper, we instead focus on the regime $m_{A'} \gtrsim 10^{-9}eV$, when resonant conversions happen before recombination. 
At such high redshifts, inhomogeneities are unimportant, and we can safely take the universe to be homogeneous.
Our goal is to accurately compute the spectral distortion produced by these conversions, and use the COBE-FIRAS data to set limits on $\epsilon$ as a function of $m_{A'}$\@. 
This regime was first considered in {% cite Mirizzi:2009iz %}; however, they assumed that the spectral distortion produced by resonant conversion only evolves via redshifting, i.e that photons are always free-streaming. 
In fact, any spectral distortion can potentially be redistributed as a function of time due to efficient Compton scattering between photons and electrons in the epoch before recombination.
Subsequently, {% cite McDermott:2019lch %} derived limits on $\epsilon$ by assuming that distortions from $\gamma \to A'$ conversions are identical to distortions produced in the CMB when the equivalent amount of energy is removed from baryons at the same redshift, leading to so-called pure $\mu$- and $y$-distortions. 
This, however, is also not a good approximation: the actual CMB spectral distortion from photon removal can be significantly different from those corresponding to energy removal from baryons, as pointed out in {% cite Chluba:2015hma %}. 
The spectral distortion therefore does not correspond to a pure $\mu$- or $y$-distortion, and cannot be compared directly to limits on the $|\mu|$ and $|y|$ parameters, as was done in {% cite McDermott:2019lch %}. Instead, the full distortion must be carefully computed, and compared to the full COBE-FIRAS data. 

We apply the Green's function method developed in {% cite Chluba:2015hma %} for photon injection/removal to accurately compute the spectral distortion due to $\gamma \to A'$ conversions. 
We obtain accurate results when resonant conversions occur during the $\mu$-era (when Compton scattering is highly efficient at redistributing photons, applicable to $m_{A'}$ in the approximate range of $3\times 10^{-6} - 5\times 10*{-5}$eV and in the $y$-era (when Compton scattering is inefficient, applicable to $m_{A'}$ in the approximate range of $10^{-9} - 2\times 10*{-8}$eV. 
In the intermediate $\mu$-$y$ transition era, we have obtained reliable approximations for the spectral distortion, allowing us to set a conservative limit on $\epsilon$ in the mass range $2\times 10^{-8} - 3\times 10*{-6}$eV. 
Our new limits strengthen existing limits by up to a factor of $3$, and are particularly important in setting a benchmark for upcoming Light-Shining-Through-Walls experiments such as DarkSRF, which offer a complementary search strategy for dark photons in the $10^{-9} - 10*{-5}$eV. 


The cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is an extraordinary tool to explore physics beyond the standard
model. Due to the exquisite precision of its measurements, it constitutes a natural
place to look for small effects due to the hidden universe. In particular, CMB spectral distortions can be used to unveil the existence of dark photons, massive vectors kinetically coupled to the standard photon. We use FIRAS data to derive self-consistent and robust limits on photon-to-dark-photon oscillations for a large range of dark photon masses, from $10^{-10}$  - $10^{-4}$ $eV$. We consider in detail the redshift dependence of the bounds, using Green’s function formalism for photon injection to compute the CMB distortions at large redshifts. Our treatment supersedes previous works, which either used Green’s function for energy injection rather than photon injection or ignored the redshift dependence of the distortions. The difference between
our treatment and previous ones is particularly noticeable in the spectral shape of the
distortions, a smoking gun signature for photon-to-dark-photon oscillations. This may
be crucial for future CMB missions (along the lines of PIXIE), which could improve
the present sensitivity by several orders of magnitude, exploring regions of the dark
photon parameter space that are otherwise very difficult to access.
