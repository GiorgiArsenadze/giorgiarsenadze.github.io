The dark photon is a hypothetical particle that offers one of the few possible renormalizable connections between the Standard Model of particle physics and a hidden dark sector. A significant body of research is dedicated to detecting dark photons, particularly at very low masses. These efforts include terrestrial experiments such as Cavendish–Coulomb setups, light-shining-through-wall experiments, helioscopes, and the direct detection of dark photons emitted by the Sun. The search also extends to astrophysical phenomena such as stellar energy loss and black hole superradiance. Furthermore, the electromagnetic environments of planets like Jupiter and Earth offer useful constraints on extremely light dark photons. However, these searches are fundamentally limited as the interaction between dark photons and Standard Model particles weakens dramatically when the dark photon mass approaches zero.

Among all detection methods, distortions to the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are among the most sensitive ways to probe dark photon properties. In the early universe, CMB photons were in thermal equilibrium with baryons and followed a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum. This distribution remains largely unchanged to the present day, as confirmed by the COBE-FIRAS experiment, which measured deviations to be less than one part in ten thousand. Future experiments such as PIXIE, PRISM, and SPECTER aim to improve this sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. Any process that injects or removes photons from the CMB after thermal equilibrium can leave a signature in the form of spectral distortions, making the CMB an excellent probe for dark photons and other hidden-sector particles.

One potential source of distortion is the conversion of regular photons into dark photons through a process known as kinetic mixing. These conversions can occur throughout the history of the universe, especially when the density of free electrons causes the effective mass of photons to match the mass of the dark photon. The nature and timing of these conversions determine how the resulting spectral distortions evolve. In particular, there is a clear distinction between the effects produced before and after the era of recombination, when the universe transitioned from opaque to transparent.

Our work focuses on scenarios where dark photon conversions occur before recombination, a regime that had not been fully explored in previous studies. In this period, photon scattering with electrons was highly efficient and can significantly alter the resulting distortions. We model these effects using a Green's function approach to photon injection and removal. By comparing the predicted spectral distortions with COBE-FIRAS data, we derive new and robust constraints on the dark photon’s kinetic mixing parameter across a wide range of masses.

We show that our constraints strengthen existing limits by up to a factor of three. These results are particularly relevant for upcoming laboratory experiments such as DarkSRF, which aim to explore the same mass range using complementary techniques. Additionally, the spectral shape of the distortion provides a unique fingerprint that could help distinguish dark photon signals from other new physics scenarios in future high-precision CMB observations.

The CMB remains one of the most powerful tools for testing fundamental physics. Its extreme precision makes it a natural place to search for the subtle effects caused by particles in the hidden universe. Our work provides a self-consistent and data-driven method for probing dark photon physics, setting the stage for deeper exploration in the years ahead.
