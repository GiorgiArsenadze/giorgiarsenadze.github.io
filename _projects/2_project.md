Particle coarsening—the process by which small particles merge into larger ones—is a phenomenon observed in both physical and biological systems. In thermal systems, coarsening dynamics have been studied extensively through experiments and theory, revealing behaviors like Ostwald ripening and diffusion-limited growth. In such contexts, the particle volume distribution often follows a predictable power-law scaling. However, in human cells, the largest liquid droplets—nucleoli—display anomalous coarsening behavior. Instead of the expected distribution, nucleoli exhibit a different scaling, suggesting that their environment, specifically chromatin, plays a crucial role in influencing their coalescence dynamics.
In this work, we investigate the physical mechanisms underlying this anomalous coarsening. Through live imaging of human cells, we observe that nucleolar coarsening consistently follows the same unusual scaling throughout the cell cycle. Prior to nucleoli merging, we detect a localized reduction in chromatin density and increased droplet motion—suggesting chromatin depletion may facilitate their coalescence. Simulations further support that an effective attraction between nucleoli, possibly mediated by chromatin reorganization, can lead to the observed behavior. These results highlight chromatin’s active role in shaping nucleolar dynamics, and our study provides a new framework for understanding phase-separated organelles within complex cellular environments.

    Fluorescent imaging of HeLa cells shows chromatin (green, H2B-GFP) and nucleoli (red, NPM-mApple) during the cell cycle. Nucleoli progressively coarsen over time. Coalescence events show nucleoli approaching and fusing, with volume distributions measured across eight time points. The distribution follows a characteristic scaling of $p(V) \propto V^{-1}$. Volumes were calculated for 141 nucleoli from 35 cells. Analysis distinguishes between fusing (N = 38) and non-fusing (N = 103) nucleoli, normalized to their size at 3 h post-mitosis. Schematics illustrate nucleolar coalescence and chromatin arrangement. Shaded areas represent standard error.
